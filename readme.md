# BuildTool Tag:



The //go:build tools and // +build tools lines are build constraint tags, also known as build tags in Go (Golang). They indicate when the file should be included in the package compilation.

A build tag, or a build constraint, is a line comment that begins with // +build that appears before the package clause. For a file to be included in the package, the build tags must be true (the conditions must be met).

The new style //go:build tools is introduced since Go 1.17 to improve readability and added features over the old-style // +build tools. Go 1.17 recommends the new //go:build style, but it will still recognize the old // +build style for backward compatibility.

The tools tag specifically is often used in files that import code for side effects to ensure certain dependencies are included in the go.mod file, even if they are not directly used in the application code. Such dependencies might be needed for generating code or running tests or other tooling.

Here in your provided code, the import block includes several packages using a blank identifier _. This means the packages are imported for their side effects (in this case, probably to ensure the necessary protocol buffer and gRPC plugins are available for code generation). The build tags mean this file will only be included when the tools build tag is specified.

Typically, you might run or build this with a command like go build -tags tools or go test -tags tools. If the tools tag is not specified, this file will not be included in the build.
